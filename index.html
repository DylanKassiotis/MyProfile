          <h2>Info</h2>
          <p>I am a uni student studying information technology with an ambition to enter the cybersecurity or software industry. I come from a Greek background originating from the island of Kos. As of now, I have studied the foundation of
            accounting, economics, management, Java and I have self-taught HTML, CSS, and a little of greek. in m pastime, I like to play a variety of games on the pc. An interesting fact about me and my last name, in particular, is that it
            originates back to world war 2. around the time of the nazi invasion of Greece, my Granpa (or papou in greek) named Nickolas kassiou tried enlisting but couldn't as he had a cousin with the same name. As a result, he changed his possibly
            millennia-old last name to Kassiotis to defend his nation.<br>

          <div class="Interest-In-IT-Text">
            <h3>Interest in I.T and when it started </h3>
            <p>In the vast I.T industry, I'm particularly fascinated by cybersecurity, software as a service, implementation of innovative software or products. lastly, data, and how it can improve efficiency. I believe my fascination
              began at a young age, I loved business and technology, after studying a bachelor in business I realized I don't like
              human recourses. as a result, that cemented my ambition in the information technology industry for my future.</p>

            <h3>Particilar event that sparked my interest and my experience </h3>
            <p>I remember at a young age watching iron man make revolutionary technology to help save people. secondly, the movie <strong>Jobs</strong> showed the beginning of Apple and how Steve Jobs changed the world with a single device that fits
              in my pocket. Unfortunately, I'm lacking much experience however I have self-taught the programming languages
              HTML, CSS, java, and I have bought courses in cybersecurity, python, and javascript that I will commence shortly.</p>

            <h3>Why i chose <strong id="red-font">RMIT</strong> </h3>
            <p>I chose RMIT for my studies for it offers courses online and in the key subjects I have an ambition in (Cloud Computing, Security in Computing and IT). </p>

            <h3>What I expect to learn during my studies</h3>
            <p>I plan on completing a bachelor's in information technology with a minor in accounting and electives in economics and marketing. I expect and hope my studies with RMIT
              will teach me the in-demand skills in the industry. additionally, the mindset of a person in the industry.</p>

          <h3>INFJ</h3>
          <p>The INFJ is the rarest personality type, that commonly has the goals of helping people on a large scale and they often live by and strongly defend their beliefs but know when not to minimize a conflict
            The Strengths of the INFJ is:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Creative</strong> - They often like to solve the problems of thier loved ones often by using their imagination.</li>
            <li><strong>Insightful</strong> - Often tries to skip appearences and small talk and would rather have deep conversations. therfore, INFJ's have an ability to understand peoples motives, feelings, and needs.</li>

            <li><strong>Principled</strong> - Tend to have deeply held beliefs and strongly defends them.</li>

            <li><strong>Passionate</strong> - Being of highly ambitious nature, it is difficult to settle and has extreme ideals to pursue their ideals.</li>

            <li><strong>Altruistic</strong> - commonly has goals that would help the world as a whole and generally uses their strengths for the greater good</li>

            <p> The Weakness's of the INFJ is:</p>
            <li><strong>Sensitive to criticism</strong> - Because the INFJ live off of there principles they can often react strongly to criticism when someone challenges there values.</li>
            <li><strong>Reluctennt to open up</strong> - although they value honesty, INFJ's tend to stay private. This can before challenging for when there having a problem but dont ask for help.</li>
            <li><strong>Perfectionist</strong> - Considering INFJ's live off of their ideals it can be hard for them when in an unideal sitiuation.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoiding the odinary</strong> - INFJ's often beileive they have a higher purpose in life. As a result, this can leas to unpleasent sitiuation's as they often believe what they have and where they are in life isnt good
              enough.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Prone to burnout</strong> - The perfectionism and intrevertedness nature can often lead to burnout. to minimise this it is highly recommended to get plenty of rest.</li>




          </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>What the results mean to me.</h3>
          <p>I believe the results of these test can help me better understand and navigate my phyci. however, I do question the validity of the test as the NSW Government's Career quiz overlaps with the Myer-Briggs test, also I have taken the
            Myer-Briggs test four time in my life which resulted in two different answers (INFJ and INTJ) either I have slipt personality's and need to see the doctor or your personality changes with the environment that your in and what you have
            done
            recently.
          </p>
          <h3>How these results would influence my behaviour in a team enviroment.</h3>
          <p>I believe that becuase i am an INFJ it would be difficult to engage in converstaion with strangers so it would help to get to know them better. Secondly, as i'm a visual learner it would help if i did video chats with the team and
            possibly flash cards as an active activity to remember key details.Lastly, As the third test revealed that im a techie, it woould be best to be working on sothing that is tech related that solves a problem.</p>

          <h3>How the results should be taken into account when forming a team.</h3>
          <p>Based off of these results, when forming a team I should try to be more open to the group members and try to connect with them in a visual way such as video chat instead of voice. I believe the results of these test can help me better
            understand and navigate my phyci. however, I do question the validity of the test as the NSW Government's Career quiz overlaps with the Myer-Briggs test, also I have taken the
            Myer-Briggs test four time in my life which resulted in two different answers (INFJ and INTJ) either I have slipt personality's and need to see the doctor or your personality changes with the environment that your in and what you have

      <div id="Project-Idea-Container">
        <div class="profile">
          <!--<img src="images\angela.png" alt="">-->
          <h2 class="blue-heading">Project Idea's</h2>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <br>
          <p>My project idea is a study aid application named Moleti (Greek word for study). Moleti will help students with memorization by having a flashcard and Pomodoro timer functionality. Secondly, Moleti will also have notetaking that would
            allow the user to reflect upon their notes in the Cornell notetaking method. And Moleti will have organizational benefits by allowing the user to make their study calendar to evolve around their life schedule. As a result of these
            functionalities students should be able to memorise the information for longer and be able to reflect upon there notes at ease after there studies.</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>I believe many of the features of Moleti will have a beneficial impact on decision making, productivity and memorisation of its users. For instance, (Danziger, Levav and Avnaim-Pesso, 2011) reveal in a study that during daily
            proceedings, the likelihood of a favourable conviction from a judge will gradually fall around 65%. However, after the judge has had recess the likelihood of a favourable and fair conviction will rise by around 65%. Secondly, (Ariga and
            Lleras, 2011) did a study that uncovers that the decrementation of focus during long task’s such as studying is avoidable by implementing brief breaks where you focus your attention on a secondary task.</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>Moleti will revolutionize the way you study, available on desktop and online, it will have the feature Pomodoro Method with this feature you will be able to use the popular time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo. To use
            this feature, you can click the task section to write down your objectives to complete during the Pomodoro. Meanwhile, set the estimated time to complete that task (note one Pomodoro equals twenty-five minutes). Afterwards, select the
            task that you would like to complete then start the timer. Once started, work for twenty-five minutes then have a five-minute break when the audio notification system starts. If you do not want to do the pre-set timer you can also
            customize the time to suit your preference. The second feature Moleti has is the Cornell note-taking system, with this feature you can create a new document and then write in the Cornell style, edit it or change its layout, delete it,
            download as a
            pdf, or print and share it. Additionally, you can click the flashiphy button to make the bullet points into flashcards. With the third feature of flashcards, you can download pre-existing online or make your own. The Flashcards are also
            downloadable to print or share. This is a useful tool for revision and memorization. Lastly, the Organizer feature is an organization tool that can be used to make a mind map, a to-do list, or an org-chart, this feature is ideal for
            teamwork as you can set objectives and see what your team mates are doing.</p>
          <br>
          <hr>
          <h3>Tools and techologies</h3>
          <p> The Tools and technologies required in order to make a web and software application would be programming languages such as
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="TAT-ul">HTML which handles the text</li>
            <li class="TAT-ul">CSS is the colour and design elements</li>
            <li class="TAT-ul">lastly JavaScript which is used for the animations
              For the ide Atom would be used as a text editor, file manager, compiler and a translator.</li>
          </ul>
          <p> Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop would be used for the design of the user interface components. Another language that could be used is Java which is
            an object-oriented programming language that supports web and desktop (Windows) applications, it is also compatible for Android applications.</p>
